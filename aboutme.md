My name is Kumar Veeravel, and I am currently studying Data Science at Lambda School. I am excited about data science because I think it provides us a means to leverage the vast amount of infomration that we have about the world. 

I studied mechanical engineering, and I have worked as an electrical engineer at Worldwide Aeros (A blimp manufacturer). I have also worked as a video game tester. I am trying to shift into the software industry to be able to work on faster paced projects, and improve my personal workflow through automation.
